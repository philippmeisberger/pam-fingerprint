PAM Fingerprint
---------------

Pluggable Authentication Module (PAM) for fingerprint authentication.

pamfingerprint is a Python written Pluggable Authentication Module (PAM) which uses pam_python to work with operating system like a native C module. It allows biometric (passwordless) authentication with the ZFM-20 fingerprint sensor manufactored by ZhianTec (known as "Arduino fingerprint sensor"). The connection to the UART fingerprint sensor will be established via Pyserial. A default USB TTL converter can be used to connect the device.

For default the standard passwort authentication is set as fallback in case no fingerprint sensor is connected. The module has to be configured by the pamfingerprint-conf program. It allows (as root) to bind or unbind users to pamfingerprint. To simulate an authentication process the pamfingerprint-check program can be used.
