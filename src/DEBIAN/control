Description: A Unix PAM module for biometric fingerprint authentification.
 It is totally written in python and uses a python framework called pam_python as adapter to implement the PAM interface that is written in C. PAM Fingerprint uses the Adafruit optical fingerprint sensor (http://www.adafruit.com/products/751) for biometric authentification. Pyserial, a python written library for serial connections, is used for the connection between the sensor and a computer. The sensor is connected with a USB TTL converter.
