.SH NAME
PAM Fingerprint - Pluggable Authentication Module (PAM) for fingerprint authentication

.SH DESCRIPTION
PAM Fingerprint is a Python written Pluggable Authentication Module (PAM) which uses \fBpam_python\fR to work with operating system like a native C module. It allows biometric (passwordless) authentication with the ZFM-20 fingerprint sensor manufactored by ZhianTec (known as "Arduino fingerprint sensor"). The connection to the UART fingerprint sensor will be established via \fBPyserial\fR. A default USB TTL converter can be used to connect the device.
.br

Per default the standard password authentication is set as fallback in case no fingerprint sensor is connected. The module has to be configured by the \fBpamfingerprint-conf\fR program. It allows (as root) to bind or unbind users to \fBpamfingerprint\fR. To simulate an authentication process the \fBpamfingerprint-check\fR program can be used.
